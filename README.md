### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Rahaf ðŸ˜Š

I am a Software Engineer who recently achieved a Distinction in Software Engineering for my Master's degree from Cardiff University. With over 7 years of experience in FullStack development, I particularly find the frontend aspects most enjoyable.



I attended a React Bootcamp with Re-coded in 2021, and here are some of the Project I did back then:

- [Animal Adoption:](https://github.com/Rofy87/capstone-turkey-animal-adoption) a website for animal adoption using React, Firebase for authentication (including Google Login), and implementing Redux for state management.

- [Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/Rofy87/portfolio)  with React deployed on [Netlify](https://rahafshora.netlify.app/)

- [Kaban Board - Trello-Alike](https://github.com/Rofy87/portfolio)
